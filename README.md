Legal Joe React is the front-end of an application designed to analyse contracts.
It was designed to be highly customisable for the Owner, as to allow him to edit the text and images easily, without to dive into the code.

It was create with create-react-app, and contains a hand-made CMS.

Several packages were included to facilitate this customisability, and it uses Material UI for some of these components.
